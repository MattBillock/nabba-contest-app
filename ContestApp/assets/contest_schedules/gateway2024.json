In 1985, Don Stine, the director of the city band in Mt. Vernon, Iowa, attended a seminar on the growing brass band movement in the United States. A workshop was arranged in eastern Iowa in February of 1986. There were 34 brass and percussion musicians who attended that 2-day event which culminated in a concert at Lindale Mall in Cedar Rapids.\r\n\u200b\r\nFollowing the clinic, regular rehearsals were held in Mt. Vernon in preparation for the 1986 NABBA Championships in Indianapolis, Indiana. After a strong second place finish, Eastern Iowa Brass Band, Inc. was established as a non-profit, tax-exempt corporation. In 2018 Iowa Brass relocated to its current home in Solon, Iowa. Eastern Iowa Brass Band was put into a hiatus like most live music performance groups during the pandemic. During that time, the members envisioned a new future for brass entertainment, committed themselves to a new chapter in the life of the group and rebranded as Iowa Brass. \r\n\u200b\r\nSince 1986, Iowa Brass has been entertaining audiences throughout Iowa, the Midwest, and beyond. Iowa Brass is made up of about 35 amateur musicians who live around the Iowa City/Cedar Rapids metro area and rehearsals are held on Thursday evenings in Solon. Iowa Brass typically performs 15 - 20 concerts each year featuring original works for brass band as well as arrangements of popular, jazz, orchestral and wind band music.",
