Keith\u2019s first home in the US was in northeast Ohio, and shortly after his arrival knowledge that he was living in the area led to the formation of Brass Band of the Western Reserve, a band he led with distinction until the summer of 2021. Each of the bands Keith has directed has established an outstanding reputation for their concert presentations, and these have been enhanced by the inclusion of some of his own brass band arrangements. Keith has more than 120 published arrangements with publishers in Britain, Switzerland, and the US.",

To make these connections, the band commits to performing far more than ordinary concerts, instead telling stories that engage the audience in the musical performance. It is this approach that has earned the band an international reputation.\r\n\r\nDSB has performed and competed extensively throughout the Midwest, and has traveled and performed abroad. In 2016 the band played concerts in Ireland and England before competing in Brass in Concert in Gateshead, England. In 2020 the band once again traveled to England, competing at the Butlins Festival.",

MCBB has been a prominent part of the national brass band movement, known for its innovation and musical contributions.\r\n\r\nMCBB was founded in 1996 by John Aren, a Salvation Army officer and former member of the Illinois Brass Band. The band's inaugural Music Director and Conductor was Craig Strain, who held these roles for 25 years. In 2021, Craig Strain was named Music Director Emeritus, and in 2022, Gordon Ward assumed the position of the band's new Music Director & Conductor.\r\n\r\nThe band has a rich history of participating in brass band competitions. MCBB consistently takes part in the North American Brass Band Association (NABBA) Championships. In 2019, MCBB was named runner-up in the Second Section. After a two-year hiatus due to COVID, the NABBA Championships resumed in 2022, where MCBB achieved a historic milestone by winning First Place in the Second Section. In 2023, MCBB also participated in the US Open Brass Band Championship, successfully defending its Challenge Section title. Additionally, MCBB's trombone section received recognition as the Outstanding Trombone Section of the day. In 2023, MCBB secured its fifth consecutive Detroit Music Award as the Outstanding Classical Small Ensemble.\r\n\r\nThe band's musical excellence has been acknowledged on a national level. MCBB was invited to perform as the state representative for Michigan State Day at the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts in Washington, DC, in 2001. Over the years, MCBB has been invited to perform at various events, including multiple appearances with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra at Greenfield Village for the annual Salute To America concerts.\r\n\r\nIn a commitment to carry forward the British brass band tradition, Motor City Youth Brass Band was established in 2006 as part of the MCBB organization. This initiative has evolved into the Motor City Academy Brass Band, which in 2022 made its debut appearance at the North American Brass Band Championships, securing First Place in the Open Section.\r\n\r\nThrough its performances across the region, participation in events like the Motor City Festival of Bands, and numerous school outreach concerts, Motor City Brass Band lives up to its motto, \"It's more than a concert, it's a SHOW!\"",
