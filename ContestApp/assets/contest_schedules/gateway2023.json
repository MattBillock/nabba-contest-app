      "band_bio": "The Chicago Brass Band is a 30-piece brass and percussion ensemble formed in the British brass band tradition, but with Chicago flair. The band, led by music director Dr. Mark Taylor, just celebrated its 20th anniversary. During its first two decades, the Chicago Brass Band has won the North American Brass Band Championship, been awarded Most Entertaining Band at the US Open Brass Band Championships, twice competed in the World Music Contest in the Netherlands, participated in the renowned Whit Friday Marches in England, has been a featured ensemble in front of 40,000 brass fans at the Great American Brass Festival, competed in the 2019 New Zealand National Brass Band Championships, and won first prize at the 2019 Gateway British Brass Band Festival. The band’s favorite activity, however, remains dazzling audiences in Chicago, one of the world’s premiere cities for brass musicianship. The band has particularly enjoyed performances with soloists drawn from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra’s celebrated brass section, including Chris Martin, Charlie Vernon, Gene Pokorny, John Hagstrom, and Mark Ridenour, and multiple collaborations with famed artist Rex Richardson. The Chicago Brass Band was selected to be a Chamber Group at the 2011 Midwest Band and Orchestra Clinic in Chicago, with guest soloist Jens Lindemann- rekindling the brass band movement at this annual convention. Additionally, the Chicago Brass Band has continued engaging young musicians with its Project Horizon initiative, a program developed to promote and enhance the performance and enjoyment of live music in public schools. Through collaborative concerts, workshops, and clinics, the band inspires students to continue to perform and enjoy live music at a high level into and throughout adulthood, even if they do not pursue music as their chosen profession.",

Helen is a native of England and grew up in the brass band tradition before attending the Royal Northern College of Music. From there, she became one of the world’s foremost baritonists and performed with some of the finest bands in the United Kingdom. Her passion for music education and this rich tradition led her to establish the FCYBA. The FCYBA began as day-long ‘Expo’ workshops and has grown into season-long brass bands with over 150 members. There are four bands within the Academy made up of brass and percussionists of all standards and abilities from late elementary through young adult. The bands of the FCYBA are non-cut programs for participants 18 years of age and younger. The conductors for the FCYBA bands are professional music educators that also perform with the Fountain City Brass Band. The bands meet during the spring academic semester once per week on Sundays. Since its inception, the bands of the FCYBA have won numerous national championships at the North Ameri- can Brass Band Championships and been featured at prestigious events such as the Great American Brass Band Festival and the Kansas Music Educators Association’s annual conference.",
