His success has continued in this country as he has led the first-placed band on 5 occasions in different sections of the North American Brass Band Championships. Since moving to the US in 1996, he has been delighted to receive several invitations to return to Britain to conduct and following a recent appearance one commentator wrote a 'welcome return to the UK of a conductor of proven 24 carat class' (Iwan Fox, 4barsrest). Keith\u2019s first home in the US was in northeast Ohio, and shortly after his arrival knowledge that he was living in the area led to the formation of Brass Band of the Western Reserve, a band he led with distinction until the summer of 2021. Each of the bands Keith has directed has established an outstanding reputation for their concert presentations, and these have been enhanced by the inclusion of some of his own brass band arrangements. Keith has more than 120 published arrangements with publishers in Britain, Switzerland, and the US.",

To make these connections, the band commits to performing far more than ordinary concerts, instead telling stories that engage the audience in the musical performance. It is this approach that has earned the band an international reputation.\r\n\r\nDSB has performed and competed extensively throughout the Midwest, and has traveled and performed abroad.
